# nkey, tkey, skeyMin, skeyMax, svalMin, svalMax, arrLen, testSize, serialization_function
# nkey: number of keys | tkey: type of keys | skey: size of keys (min, max) | sval: size of values
# arrLen: (only used in combined) length of the struct array
# supported types(tkey): int32_t, double, string, combined
# in combined, nkey represents each number of elements (e.g. 2 => two ints, two floats, two strings) 
# sval only uses when the type(tkey) is string
# string means: char {variable length = skey} [{sval + 1}]
# adding 1 in sval means it needs a space for null character
# serialization_function names:
# JSON, MP (MessagePack), FX (FlexBuffers), PB (Protocol Buffers), TH (Apache Thrift), FB (FlatBuffers)
